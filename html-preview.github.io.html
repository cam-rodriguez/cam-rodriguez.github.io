<meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"></head><body>**Hi!
** If you’re reading this, you probably got it from somewhere on the 
internet — unless someone printed it out, which is impressive. (Unless 
it was because _I_ printed it out, which is maybe less impressive.)

### My name is Cam, and I’m an investigative and data reporter. I’m 
looking for a new job! 🔎

&gt; * I’m based in Chicago, Illinois, an incredible city for journalism
 and hearty meals.
&gt; * I’ve centered my career working on in-depth stories with local 
impact.
&gt; * I’d love to find a role that has me working in the in-between of 
enterprise, investigative, data and service journalism.
&gt; * The best way to contact me is 
[heycamrodriguez@gmail.com](mailto:heycamrodriguez@gmail.com).

**Currently, I’m a Local Investigations Fellow at The New York Times**, 
which has me criss-crossing Illinois in pursuit of stories about the 
presence of the shipping and logistics industry, one of the 
fastest-growing industries in the state. 

**My fellowship ends in September, and I’m eager to join a team 
connecting with local communities and telling impactful, important 
stories.** Most importantly, I’m keen to find a place that encourages 
professional development and growth, and sees the importance in 
investing in project-based reporting, especially when it takes a little 
bit of time.

----

**I’ve regularly learned new skills in pursuit of stories**, including 
new programming languages, software, reporting strategies and ways to 
structure and document my work. I’ve also regularly taught new skills to
 other folks in and out of the newsroom: leading community workshops on 
FOIA and records requests, speaking to other newsrooms about 
applications of data reporting and chatting with college students about 
how to break into data. As a reporter, this is just as essential to me 
as communicating stories to readers!

### Some skills I have that people may be looking for:
<details>
  <summary>📝 <b>Longform enterprise reporting and writing</b>, thanks in part to good coffee and good music</summary>
 I’ve regularly filed novellas for drafts, though I certainly don’t have
 to. I’m adept and open at cutting down drafts as easily as I am 
building them up. With some strong coffee and good music, I can churn 
out thousands of words on a deadline, and work with an editor to trim 
the fat.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>📑 <b>Technical writing and documentation</b>, including version control and methodologies</summary>
 Owing it to my experience as a data reporter, I’ve homed in on making 
documenting my work a priority, writing guides and memos on how I 
execute my work on projects. This is something that’s critical not just 
for future me, but for other team members, making sure handoffs are as 
seamless as possible.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>👩‍💻 <b>Data analysis and cleaning</b>, like with SQL, Python and spreadsheets, to find patterns in data</summary>
  I’m comfortable reading many different programming languages, which 
lets me take into account code others have used, as well as writing new 
code. I typically use SQL, Python or a spreadsheet software for 
day-to-day data analysis, though I’m always open to learning more. For 
data cleaning, it depends on the dataset, but I'm partial to open-source
 tools like OpenRefine and Tabula.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>📊 <b>Data visualization</b>, like with Datawrapper, HTML/CSS and JavaScript</summary>
  Multiple past roles I’ve had were partially or entirely focused on 
visualizing data for readers and reporters. This includes using 
JavaScript, HTML and CSS, and programs like Datawrapper, Flourish and 
others, as well as in-house systems like dailygraphics.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>🗺️ <b>Cartography and working with spatial data</b>, like with QGIS, ArcGIS, postgresql and satellite imagery</summary>
 I have a minor, certificate and graduate coursework in geographic 
information systems, aka digital mapmaking. This has been applied in 
every job I’ve had, and looks like anything from building custom 
interactive graphics, fact-checking a map shown at a public meeting, 
analyzing patterns in different kinds of data, looking at the change 
over time of a place with satellite imagery, running complex machine 
learning analyses, digitizing historical maps, and many others. (Can you
 tell I like doing this? :-) )
</details>
<details open="">
  <summary>🗂️ <b>Records requests</b>, with FOIA and others, both at a small and large (1k+) scale </summary>
 This is something I consider to be a key function of any job I have. 
FOIA is one of the best tools at a reporters’ disposal! I’ve used FOIA 
to build out and update a database on public employee salaries, to 
identify conflicts of interest in school district projects, to demystify
 a mounting pandemic, and to better understand what records agencies 
keep. In 2023, I filed approximately 1,500-2,000 FOIA requests to 
different agencies around Illinois, and had a 95% return rate (and 
didn't pay a cent!).
</details>
<details>
  <summary>🗃️ <b>Database creation and management</b>, including interactive databases for readers and reporters alike</summary>
 I’m typically very excited to build out massive databases in the 
pursuit of a story, which I’ve done in almost every role I’ve been in. 
I’m comfortable processing existing databases in whatever format they 
come in, and built out databases and data pipelines with different 
methods as well. A focus of mine is making it as useful as possible for 
reporters, which includes setting clear rules about version control and 
making platforms accessible for everyone.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>📚 <b>Archival research</b>, using finding aids, pawing through old clips, going to libraries and more</summary>
  Part of my personal interest as a reporter is bridging the past with 
present, and that includes looking at archives and library collections 
for stories. I’ve been in many roles where that’s been at the core of 
the work, like going down goose chases for readers to figure out what 
they missed on a school field trip in the 1950s, for example. But I’ve 
also used it to hold present-day institutions to account, work that made
 me a finalist for the Online Journalism Awards.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>🗣️ <b>Public speaking and teaching</b>, including with IRE/NICAR, ONA and EWA</summary>
  Like reporting, I think education is a very powerful tool to help 
people hold the powerful to account. I’ve jumped at opportunities to 
help teach my community how to better equip themselves to push electeds 
to a transparent path; sessions I led, in person and digitally, 
regularly netted positive ratings and often exceeded attendance 
expectations. On top of this, I’ve been a regular speaker at conferences
 around the country, teaching other reporters tangible skills and 
speaking about the work I’ve done with different teams.
